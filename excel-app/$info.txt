1. accessing individual modules (e.g. calcroyalties.py):
python3 -m database.calcroyalties

2. virtualenv for self-contained virtual environment.
after environment is created, install all dependencies with "pip install -r requirements.txt"

3. testing
install pytest (probably makes sense to install systemwide, not in virtualenv) with "pip install pytest"
run with "py.test" at the root directory of the project, pytest will start auto test discovery
run tests for individual files with "py.test database/calcroyalties.py" from root directory
you can even run "py.test calcroyalties.py" from "database" directory, it will still work
adding "--cov" will generate a coverage report, like so "py.test --cov" 
or for individual file "py.test --cov database/calcroyalties.py"
adding "--cov-report html" will generate a standard html coverage report

4. continuous integration
see www.travis-ci.org, login credentials tbd
CI build is triggered by every github push
CI script is at ".travis.yml" in repository root directory
each CI build also runs code coverage and uploads it to www.codecov.io, login credentials tbd
